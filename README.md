AircraftWar game HTML5
=========
Initially, I wanted to try recreating Wechat percil aircraft in HTML5, CSS3 using a canvas and recycling the assets from the old game.

Recreated Wechat Pencil aircraft game in HTML5, CSS3, Jquery using divs and recycling the assets from the old game.I Used Separating Axis Theorem to implement collision detections. It is able to scale on almost any screen (mobile and desktop). 
Live App
------------
Check out a live preview of it over here: http://jianleiusc.github.io/

To be done
-----------
1. The color of aircrafts is not consistent with the background
2. Bugs that some enemy aircraft is not removed from game container, and will reappear
3. The collision is not implemented yet(will be done in several days)
4. Score feature, sound effects need to be added
5. More types of enemy aircrafts need to be implemented

Notice
=====
The assets powering the visual element of the game have all been extracted directly from the wechat pencil aircraft game. I have only done the coding, not designed the visual elements.  
I do not own the assets, nor do I have explicit permission to use them from their creator.   
If the copyright holder would like for the assets to be removed, let me know!
